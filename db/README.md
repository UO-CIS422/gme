# Subdirectory db: What is here?

__init__.py is an empty file that is apparently required for me to
import modules stored in this directory.

initdb-sqlite.py is a script that initializes a database sqlite.db .
The file sqlite.db is not in github;  running initdb-sqlite.py
from the main Flask directory is what creates it.
